In that phase, we focused on a content farm\n              5-minute crafts and their YouTube channel. We collected data on\n              elements such as representation of women, their body parts and\n              human expressions on thumbnails and titles and keywords used in\n              the videos and used this to study their correlation with the\n              number of views. We interpreted this data to identify trends in\n              the algorithms of YouTube, which finally led us to investigate how\n              content farms use these trends to increase their reach.\n              <br /> <br />\n              With this data, we are able to recreate the content farm business\n              model that uses social media for monetization, making profits with\n              both the content farm company and the social networking site. In\n              this project, we present this business model that uses YouTube,\n              Facebook, Instagram and Pinterest to monetize and create traffic\n              on company websites. We present it from different perspectives:\n              the content farm company, the algorithms of online platforms and\n              their users.\n              <br /> <br />\n              <em>User In The Wondertube</em> presents a story of a user\n              browsing through YouTube.

In the story, the user\n              converses with different entities such as the YouTube algorithm,\n              the channel creator, Facebook and Instagram. The viewer is able to\n              see how the algorithm takes the user through this journey and in\n              the process how the creators/companies monetise on this journey.\n              The project explores the possibility of users losing control of\n              their browsing experience and being dictated by the algorithm.\n            </p>\n          </Col>\n          <Col>\n            <h2 className=\"heading-lg yellow-background\">AIM, FOCUS & OBJECTIVE</h2>\n            <p>\n              <strong>User In The Wondertube</strong>\n              is a project developed during the Final Synthesis Laboratory in\n              the Density Lab at Politecnico di Milano.\n              <br /> <br />\n              This project aims to allow viewers to reflect on the content they\n              engage with online, provides insight on how algorithms and data\n              gathering works, and thereby gives them the power to self-regulate\n              how they browse online.\n              <br /> <br />\n              The project focuses on a specific audience of internet consumers\n              seeking entertainment or looking for information, tips or advice\n              on a subject online.

The user\n              journey then begins as he types in his first query on YouTube.
